##Computational Thinking: Way to Problem Solving##

>
       What is compuational Thinking ?

It is an approach to problem solving,system designing and also understanding human behaviour by drawing on the concepts fundamental to computer science . Pretty Gross ?

Simplification: Act of thinking with principles borrowed from computer.

Any problem can be solved if it is thinked in terms of :  
>    

    + Constraints   
    + Abstraction  
    + Decomposition  
    + Heuristics  
    + Algorithms  

    + Recursion  
    + Concurrency  
    + Synchronization  
    + Efficiency  
    + Elegance  

    + Tradeoffs between processing and storage  
    + Caching  
    + Interpreting code as data and data as code[imp]  
    + Prevention,detection and recovery from worst-case scenarios.  


That's all the cases researcher[J.M. Wing] could have thought of till now. So just fit your problem in terms of above parameters and one is good to go.
